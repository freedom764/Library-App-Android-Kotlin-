This Android app was made in 2023 for Mobile App Lab using Kotlin. This is a Library Management System that I made utilizing Firebase Authenticate, Firebase Real-Time Database, and Google Books API. This app is very different from what I made for the Java contest.
"report.pdf" has most of the info about the app.
